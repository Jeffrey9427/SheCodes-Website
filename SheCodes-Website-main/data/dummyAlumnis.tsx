        story: "Before SheCodes, I was exploring many areas in tech but hadn’t found my path. The SheCodes workshops introduced me to data visualization and the world of data analytics. Learning with supportive mentors and peers boosted my confidence. Thanks to the skills I gained in data visualization, machine learning, cloud, leadership, storytelling, and public speaking, I now feel more prepared to pursue my dream as a data analyst!",

SheCodes helped me build confidence and encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone.

        story: "SheCodes is a game changer to begin a STEM career journey. This is more than just a fleeting workshop, because you will make a lasting impact with a team project! Supported by a caring community, I had all I needed hereーa mentor from the Microsoft Team, real-world insight from reputable speakers, and a network from various universities. As a psychology student, I didn’t have vast knowledge about AI and cloud (or anything related to IT). The committees eagerly guided us one-on-one and patiently answered my curiosity. I never expected the friendships I built here would last long, even after we graduated from SheCodes. Now, with the help of all SheCodes members, I dare to dream of creating my own project focusing on psychotechnology.",

        story: "SheCodes opened my eyes not just to tech, but to the real impact of gender inequality in STEM. Working with my team and receiving guidance from experts in the field, we develop the concept of Anna.ai, an AI-powered platform designed to help girls navigate STEM education paths. This experience showed me how tech can drive change. I came in with almost no confidence, but by the end, I pitched an idea, told a story, and presented it in front of experts from major tech companies, something I never thought I could do. Thank you, SheCodes, for the incredible opportunity and mentorship.",
